# Landmarking with reference and blob detection
# ---------------------------------------------
# Set landmarks, e.g. for geometric morphometrics, and draw them.
# Can be multiple sets, i.e. use multiple "set_landmarks" statements
# if you want to quantify morphometrics of different specimens, traits or
# objects in the same image. Specify arguments for "set_" and "draw_"
# separately. If a template for a reference card has been created
# on the project level, "detect_reference" will attempt to find it in
# the current image and measure the current px-ratio. This template also contains
# a segmentation step for blob detection. This can automatically detect contours
# around your specimen, and converts it to a mask, which then can be used to
# provide the ROI containing the specimen to the ml-morph plugin.
