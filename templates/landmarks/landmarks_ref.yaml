# Landmarking with reference detection
# ------------------------------------
# Set landmarks, e.g. for geometric morphometrics, and draw them. 
# Can be multiple sets, i.e. use multiple "set_landmarks" statements 
# if you want to quantify morphometrics of different specimens, traits or 
# objects in the same image. Specify arguments for "set_" and "draw_" 
# separately. If a template for a reference card has been created 
# on the project level, "detect_reference" will attempt to find it in 
# the current image and measure the current px-ratio.
