# Basic object detection 
# ----------------------
# Uses thresholding for segmentation. Contains optional morphology 
# operations to remove fine structures (see 
# https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/df6/tutorial_erosion_dilatation.html 
# for details), as well as an optional contour-editing step (clean up 
# detected contours and detect again), and default visualization and 
# export steps. Measure shape and texture features (optional).
