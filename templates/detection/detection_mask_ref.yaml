# Object detection with masking and reference detection
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Uses thresholding for segmentation, with an initial masking step 
# to remove unwanted areas  ("include: true" to ONLY include specific
# areas or "include: false" to EXCLUDE specific areas. If a template 
# for a reference card has been created on the project level, 
# "detect_reference" will attempt to find it in the current image, 
# measure the current px-ratio, and exclude it detection. Also contains 
# optional morphology operations to remove fine structures (see 
# https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/df6/tutorial_erosion_dilatation.html 
# for details), as well as an optional contour-editing step (clean up 
# detected contours and detect again), and default visualization and 
# export steps. Measure shape and texture features (optional).
